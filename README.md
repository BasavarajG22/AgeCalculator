# AgeCalculator
An age calculator is a basic yet practical web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users input their date of birth, and the JavaScript logic calculates their exact age in years, months, and days. The design, styled with CSS, ensures an interactive and user-friendly experience, making it accessible and visually appealing.
